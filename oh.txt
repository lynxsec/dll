(Verse 1)
In a world of spells and magic, I found you,
Ginny Weasley, my heart beats only for you,
From the halls of Hogwarts, where we first met,
A love like ours, I will never forget.

(Chorus)
On my Winamp, I play this song,
Every time I boot up, it won't take long,
A love that's strong, it's forever true,
Ginny Weasley, I'm enchanted by you.

(Verse 2)
In the midst of battles and heartaches we've been through,
Your fiery spirit, my guiding light, my rescue,
Our love has grown, from Quidditch pitch to the Great Hall,
Together we stand, and together we'll never fall.

(Chorus)
On my Winamp, I play this song,
Every time I boot up, it won't take long,
A love that's strong, it's forever true,
Ginny Weasley, I'm enchanted by you.

(Bridge)
Like a Patronus against the darkest night,
Your love shines bright, chasing away the fright,
I'll hold your hand, in this magical land,
Together we'll face, every twist and bend.

(Verse 3)
I'll be your Harry, and you'll be my Ginny,
A love story written in the stars, our destiny,
From the Burrow to the heart of Diagon Alley,
Our love's a potion, an everlasting remedy.

(Chorus)
On my Winamp, I play this song,
Every time I boot up, it won't take long,
A love that's strong, it's forever true,
Ginny Weasley, I'm enchanted by you.

(Outro)
So let our hearts intertwine, in a world full of wonder,
In the face of darkness, we'll never be torn asunder,
And when I'm lost, I'll find my way back to you,
Ginny Weasley, my love, my heart belongs to you.
